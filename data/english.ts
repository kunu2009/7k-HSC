      title: '1.2 On Saying Please',
      description: 'By A.G. Gardiner - Essay on courtesy and manners.',
      summary: '**Genre**: Essay\n**Author**: A.G. Gardiner\n**Theme**: Importance of courtesy and good manners in daily life.\n\nThe essay discusses how small courtesies like saying "please" and "thank you" make social life pleasant, even though discourtesy is not legally punishable.',
      detailedNotes: '### About the Author\nAlfred George Gardiner (1865-1946) was a British journalist and author. He wrote under the pen name "Alpha of the Plough."\n\n### Central Theme\nThe essay argues that while law punishes physical assault, there is no legal remedy for moral assault (rudeness). Yet, courtesy and good manners are essential for a civilized society.\n\n### Key Arguments\n1. **Law vs. Morality**: Physical assault is punishable, but rudeness is not.\n2. **Impact of Rudeness**: Discourtesy can ruin someone\'s entire day.\n3. **Chain Reaction**: Bad behavior spreads like infection.\n4. **Small Words Matter**: "Please" and "Thank you" are lubricants of social life.\n5. **Everyone Deserves Respect**: From a lift-man to a celebrity.\n\n### The Lift-Man Incident\n* A lift-man threw out a passenger who didn\'t say "Top please."\n* The passenger only said "Top" without courtesy.\n* Law sided with the passenger (physical assault).\n* But morally, the passenger was equally wrong.\n\n### The Conductor Example\n* A cheerful bus conductor spread positivity.\n* His pleasant manners made everyone\'s journey enjoyable.\n* Small courtesies create a pleasant atmosphere.\n\n### Important Quotes\n* "A civil tongue is the lubricant of social life."\n* "Courtesy costs nothing but pays well."\n* "Bad manners probably do more to poison the stream of general life than all the crimes."\n\n### Life Lessons\n1. Always use polite words.\n2. Treat everyone with respect regardless of status.\n3. Your behavior affects others\' mood.\n4. Courtesy is contagious - spread it!',

      description: 'By Walt Whitman - A poem about freedom and optimism.',
      summary: '**Poet**: Walt Whitman (American poet, "Father of Free Verse")\n**Theme**: Freedom, optimism, self-reliance, joy of travel.\n\nThe poet starts a journey on the open road, feeling free and healthy. He doesn\'t ask for good fortune; he is his own good fortune.',
      detailedNotes: '### Stanza Analysis\n1. **"Afoot and light-hearted..."**: He is happy and ready. The world is before him.\n2. **"Henceforth I ask not good-fortune..."**: He believes in himself. He is done with complaints ("indoor complaints").\n3. **"The long brown path..."**: Symbol of life\'s journey.\n4. **"Delicious burdens"**: Paradox. He carries his memories (burdens) with love. He doesn\'t want to get rid of them.\n\n### Figures of Speech\n* **Metaphor**: Road = Life.\n* **Paradox**: "Delicious burdens" (Burdens are usually heavy/bad, but here they are sweet memories).\n* **Repetition**: "I carry them..."',

      description: 'By Mamang Dai - Nature and life in Arunachal Pradesh.',
      summary: '**Poet**: Mamang Dai (Poet from Arunachal Pradesh)\n**Theme**: Nature, Death, Eternity, Preservation.\n\nThe poem describes the landscape of her hometown (Pasighat) and the river. It contrasts the permanence of nature (river) with the transience of human life (small towns).',
      detailedNotes: '### The Town\n* **Description**: "Small towns always remind me of death."\n* **Atmosphere**: Grim, silent, unchanging. "In the summer, winter, monsoon... it is always the same."\n\n### The River\n* **Description**: "The river has a soul." It cuts through the land like a torrent of grief.\n* **Significance**: It is eternal. It knows the immortality of water.\n\n### Beliefs\n* **Afterlife**: "We are all going to the same place." (Death is inevitable).\n* **Nature**: The river and mountains are permanent witnesses to human life and death.\n\n### Figures of Speech\n* **Personification**: "The river has a soul."\n* **Metaphor**: River = Grief/Eternity.\n* **Irony**: Small towns (human habitation) remind of death, while nature (river) reminds of life/eternity.',
